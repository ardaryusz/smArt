# smArt :eye:

Ever come home from school ready to relax… and then remember you’ve got **five Achieve3000 assignments due tomorrow**?

### Well, this fixes that.

**smArt** is a lightweight browser bookmarklet that injects a small floating assistant onto the assignment page and helps you get through questions with the support of artificial intelligence by:
- Reading the passage + question from the page
- Sending it to the artificial intelligence
- Automatically selecting answers for multiple-choice questions
- Generating and inserting responses for writing prompts

## How it works
1. Add the bookmarklet to your browser ( Check how to add the bookmarklet! )
2. Open an Achieve3000 activity
3. Click the bookmark → a draggable launcher appears
4. Hit **work smArt-er** to start (and **stop.** to stop)
5. Modify the settings with **the gear cog** on the bottom left of the launcher

## Settings
- Multiple-choice timing (delay between questions to mimic solving time)
- Optional random-answer percentage (to mimic real users)
- Groq URL + model (with reset to defaults)
- Single API key

> **Note:** This tool depends on Achieve3000’s page structure. If they change the markup, selectors/XPaths may need updates.
